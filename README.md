FASTMAP
=======
**FASTMAP** (**F**lexible **A**tlas **S**egmentation **T**ool for **M**ulti-**A**rea **P**rocessing) is a tool for the registration of biological images to custom atlas plastes and the segmentation of labels of interest within atlas regions.  This tool operates as an *ImageJ Plugin* that draws upon versatile and powerful image analyses tools in *ImageJ* and presents them in a clean, concise, and easy to follow pipeline. 

FASTMAP was created by Dylan Terstege, a Neuroscience PhD candidate in the Epp Lab at the University of Calgary.

### Installation Instructions

FASTMAP was designed with ease-of-use at the forefront of our minds.  The installation process reflects this with a simple 3-step approach:

 **1. Install *ImageJ***. Ensure that ImageJ is installed.  If it was not previously installed, it can be downloaded [here](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html).

**2. Download the Appropriate Version of FASTMAP.**  Download the appropriate version of FASTMAP for your operating system: [macOS](https://github.com/dterstege/FASTMAP) or [Windows](https://github.com/dterstege/FASTMAP).  Linux has not yet been tested.

**3. Install Plugin in *ImageJ***.  Open *ImageJ* and select "Plugins>Install...".  Navigate to the newly downloaded version of FASTMAP and allow this to save to the ImageJ Plugins folder.
