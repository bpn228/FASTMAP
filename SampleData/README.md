SampleData
=======
The files contained in this sample data folder can be used to demonstrate FASTMAP registration to a low level sagittal atlas.  Following the FASTMAP User's Guide, new users will be able to register a sample image and then assess label density in terms of the number of segmented objects per regions and the percentage of each region occupied by segmented object.

The sample data also demonstrates how files should be organized for FASTMAP analyses.
